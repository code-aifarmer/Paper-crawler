## `Operating conditions of the program`：
Requires **python3** or higher version, request library, and a suitable compiler that can run python programs.

The code is in the temp.py file. The program is currently set to crawl all the papers related to keywords in a page. `Attention:`The picture information of the start button of the program may need to be modified to run normally, and may need to be run before Replacement, the subsequent optimized version is under development...	:triangular_flag_on_post:
## `Operation guide`：
The GUI of this program is very concise and the operation is also very simple. Users only need to enter the keywords of the papers they want to crawl and the save address of the PDF files.
## `Follow-up goals`:
Continue to optimize the GUI of the program, increase the crawl function of the program, increase the filtering and analysis functions of the crawled content, change the setting of only crawling one page, increase the crawl function of custom pages, etc.:bulb:
## `Author's Voice`:
There are many shortcomings and problems in this program, and there are still many areas that need to be optimized and expanded. If you are interested, join us and follow me and give me a little star. Thank you for your encouragement.:blush::blush::blush:
